        <p>He has superhuman speed, strength, durability, and a regenerative healing ability. His connection to the Hell Charger, his ride, is a power unto itself, giving him the ability to teleport short distances, create portals, and become intangible with pieces of the car and also he has a weapon if this weapon touches any one that person will turn into ash and will die.</p>
